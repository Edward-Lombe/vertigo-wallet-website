            <p>
                You may have just begun to hear of cryptocurrencies in main stream media, but since its first implementaion by Satoshi Nakamoto as Bitcoin in 2009, they have progressed by leaps and bounds. Sometimes this journey has been a little rough, but the trend has always been upwards. My interest comes from the concepts that set them apart from tradiational currency, called <em>fiat</em> in many circles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in cryptocurrency as the way forward to a distributed, decentralized, and secure way to perfrom transactions in our modern day society. It is because of this belief that I have invested money, time, and effort in order to learn and aquire these curencies, and to try and spread the word to as many people as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cryptocurriencies are still very much in their infancy, however they have grow expodentialy in a vert short amount of time. Bitcoin, the orignal cryptocurrency, and the one with the most market share currently, has a market cap of over 10 <em>billion</em> USD.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to take an absoulte beginner who has never heard of Bitcoin, mining and cryptographic currency in general, help them to understand what it is all about, and at them end get them into cryptographic currency in general.
